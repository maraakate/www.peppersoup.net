<IMG SRC="este/joey.gif" ALIGN=left> <FONT COLOR="#669966">
Q1.  What is the best method of este?<BR>
A.   Good Question.  Here the basis of our Este is "set good rules = healthy lifestyle." Your best body will not be born of an unhealthy lifestlye.  Following a well balanced lifestyle is the first priority of an esthetician.<BR>
Q2.  Is it ok to call the boyfriend early on the day of the date?<BR>
A.   Yes, if Kitty is in her best condition, you can call him on the day of the date.  It is also ok to keep working on Kitty's figure until the last minute of the 7th day, but try your best not to get Time Over.<BR>
Q3.  How can I be a good estetician?<BR>
A.   Check the checkmeter often as it will tell you a lot of things.  Give her whatever care she needs.  The Metcha Diary offers good insight too, so be sure to read it!<BR><BR></TD>
