<CENTER><IMG SRC="sapling/unitmap.gif"></CENTER><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/1.gif"> Sound and light dome ... there are many different sounds and lights for each mode<BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/2.gif"> Light Sensor <BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/3.gif"> Sound Sensor <BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/4.gif"> Movement Sensor <BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/5.gif"> Touch Sensor ... use this while in the different modes.<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp *to use this sensor, be sure to touch both touch sensors at the same time<BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/6.gif"> Select Button ... use this to access the different modes<BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/7.gif"> Reset Button ... use this to start over from the beginning<BR><BR>
<B>How to play with My Sapling</B><BR>
1. Viewing the modes:<BR>
Pressing the select button will cycle through the different modes.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sapling/modes.gif"></CENTER><BR>
2. Selecting a mode:<BR>
Touch the touch sensors to enter the mode that is displayed on the screen.<BR>
*If you do not enter a mode within 30 seconds, it will automatically go to Communication Mode<BR><BR>
<B>Communication Mode</B><BR>
When not using the other modes, the unit will normally be in Communication Mode.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sapling/commmode.gif"></CENTER><BR>
* If there is no input from the Select Button or Touch Sensors within 1 minute, the curtain will close and the unit will go to standby.<BR><BR>
<B>Let's look at the growth and change animations!</B><BR>
Fulfilling basic conditions will allow you to view the growth and change animations.<BR>
1. Touch the touch sensors once. (the sensor will acknowledge you with a beep)<BR>
2. If you have fulfilled the basic conditions, fanfare will be played and the growth/change animation will begin.<BR>
*If the conditions have not been met, nothing will happen<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sapling/changescreens.gif"></CENTER><BR>
*"change" indicates a change in the way you handle your 'My Sapling', resulting in a different type of sapling, therefore there is no growth.<BR><BR>
<B>Let's Communicate!</B><BR>
Saplings love to play!  Play with your sapling a lot so it can grow.  <BR>
1. Touch the touch sensors twice. (you will be acknowledged by two beeps)<BR>
2. A melody will play.<BR>
3. The light and sound dome will flash red, green or blue three times (while beeping).<BR>
*it may be difficult to see the lights if you play the game outside or in a brightly lit room<BR>
4. After the 3 flashes, you must repeat the pattern by using the action which corresponds to the colour:<BR>
Red Light : Let the unit hear some sort of noise, such as talking<BR>
Green Light : Shake the unit gently, to let it feel motion<BR>
Blue Light : Bring the unit close to light, so it can sense brightness<BR>
5. If you get the sequence correct, you sill see your sapling smile.<BR>
If you get something wrong, it will become angry.  If you don't do something, it will begin to cry.<BR><BR>
<B>The absent sapling</B><BR>
If you do not play with your sapling often enough, it will become bored and run off somewhere.  Try different approaches to get your sapling to come back.<BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/out.gif" ALIGN="right">1. If you haven't played with your sapling for a while, touching the touch sensors once will bring up a screen like the one shown to the right.<BR>
*There are different types of 'out' screens!<BR>
2. Try making noise, putting it under lights, gently shaking it, pressing the buttons, touching the sensors, many times to get your sapling to come back.<BR>
*do not press the reset button!<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sapling/actions.gif"></CENTER><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/30min.gif" ALIGN="right">3. Even if you see your sapling, it may be in a bad mood and unwilling to return right away.  A screen like the one to the right will appear, and you will have to wait a little while. *there are different types of this screen as well!<BR><BR>
<B>A basic chart of growth</B><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/growthchart.gif" ALIGN="left">Sapling baby has been born! <BR>Play with it using all the different modes.<BR><BR>It has grown into chibi sapling!<BR>
Depending on how you communicate with it, it may change into something different.<BR><BR>
Puchi Sapling!<BR>
Play with it lots and it may grow quickly...<BR><BR>
Koko Sapling!<BR>
Just carrying this one around with you while walking may cause it to change.<BR><BR>
My Sapling!<BR>
From this point, there will be no more change or growth.  You can play with it as it is, or start over again.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<B>There are 10 different types of My Sapling.  Which one are you?</B><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/koragen.gif" ALIGN="left">KoragenShimai<BR>
These twin girls are extremely concerned about appearances.  With their smooth complexions and beautiful faces, they are very popular, but perhaps wimpy?  How would you like to have an appearance consultation?<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/dha.gif" ALIGN="left">Mr. DHA<BR>
With a good brain, he is the sharpest of all the saplings.  His main flaw is being too methodical.  Perhaps he can teach you to become smarter?<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/koubo.gif" ALIGN="left">Koubo-chan<BR>
Due to recieving a variety of nutrition, this sapling grew quickly.  It is always smiling and innocent.  When you are feeling anxious or lazy, he is saying "let's go!".<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/vitamin.gif" ALIGN="left">Vitamin-kun<BR>
He's a really laidback sort of guy, but it seems that health is the one thing he is careful about. One of his interests is secret training.  He loves pro wrestling! <BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/seni.gif" ALIGN="left">Senii<BR>
He is a big crybaby, but he loves to say "kaicho kaicho".  Nobody knows what kaicho is, but when he cries, comfort him with your kindness.<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/tetsutarou.gif" ALIGN="left">Tetsutarou<BR>
He is hot blooded and full of vigor, this sapling has a strong sense of justice.  He will protect you, and maybe be your knight in shining armour.  The contents of his knapsack are a mystery.<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/newsun.gif" ALIGN="left">New Sun<BR>
This relaxed guy comes from foreign lands.  Although he eats a lot, his digestive system seems surprisingly healthy.  Will some of his relaxed attitude rub off on you? <BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/amino.gif" ALIGN="left">Amino Ojou<BR>
She will do anything to earn a beautiful promotion.  She may become your diet pal, but she might tease, so be ready.  Raised like a princess.<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/mineral.gif" ALIGN="left">Mineral Kacho<BR>
Not there when you want him, there when you don't want him.  He may be just the thing for an over-sentimental you.<BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="sapling/nasu.gif" ALIGN="left">NasuShiumu<BR>
He is the stubborn, impatient, stout, sometimes helpful big brother figure.  He may be able to encourage and cheer on the slightly shy you.<BR><BR>

<B>My Sapling Q & A</B><BR>
Q. Nothing is showing on the screen.<BR>
A. Check the batteries.<BR><BR>
Q. Growth never seems to happen.<BR>
A. It seems that playing many times during a short period of time is better for growth than playing often over a long period of time.<BR><BR>
Q. How are Growth and Change different?<BR>
A. Growth means getting bigger and that you are one step closer to the 'My Sapling' stage.  Change means that your sapling has turned into a different type.<BR><BR>
Q. I can't get sensor mode to work well.<BR>
A. If you are having difficulties with sensor mode, try changing your methods of sensor input or try it in a different environment.<BR><BR>
