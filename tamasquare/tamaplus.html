<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/timeset.gif" ALIGN=left>Setting the time and date (and your birthday) is pretty straightforward - dates are always month/day with Tamaplus<BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/birthday.gif" ALIGN=left><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/naming.gif" ALIGN="left">Once your tamagotchi has hatched, you will be asked to name it.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/kanachart.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>A quick pronunciation guide:</B><BR>
The chart on the left shows all the letters (there are additional non-letter symbols that I have not included) you can use to name your tamagotchi.  They appear in the same order (left to right, top to bottom) as they cycle through on your tama.<BR><BR>
a="ah" i="ee" u="oo" e="eh" o="oh"<BR>
For example:<BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/mitsumame.gif"><BR>is pronounced "mee-tsoo-mah-meh"<BR>
The smaller letters in the sixth row down are modifiers - "fu" + small "a" = "fa"
"ri" + small "yu" = "ryu".  The small "tsu", defined as (t), is a sort of silent modifer - it is the symbol that sits between "go" and "chi" in Tamagotchi.

<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/begging.gif">&nbsp &nbsp<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/insecure.gif"><BR>
If you do not tend to your tamagotchi's needs when it calls you, it may start begging or turning its back to you.<BR><BR><BR>

*the infrared will not work properly in strong light (eg. sunlight)<BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/discipline.gif" ALIGN=left>There will times when you will have to scold or pet your tama.  Learning when to use the appropriate action will help you raise a good, well behaved character.<BR>
<B>when to scold:</B> when the food and happiness meters are full, but it is still calling you (call sign is lit) <BR>
<B>when to pet:</B> if it cries during the infancy or rebellious stages - if it is turning its back to you (insecure screen) even though the food and happiness meters are filled<BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/meds.gif" ALIGN=left> If either of these marks appears on the screen, you need to use the medicine icon.  If you don't treat your tama, it will die, so be careful.<BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/book.gif" ALIGN=left>The book icon (second from left, bottom of the screen) will let you see the friends you've made and some of the gifts you've received.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/bookpages.gif" ALIGN=left>Friends are numbered in the order you meet them.<BR>
The friend in the example at left is a female.  The tag for a male friend looks like this: <IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/friendosu.gif" ALIGN=middle><BR><BR><BR><BR>
If your tamagotchi plays with the same friend often, their friendship level will increase.  With gifts, however, the friendship level can dramatically increase or decrease.  The progression of friendship levels is:
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/relation.gif"><BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/ippai.gif" ALIGN=left>When you have recorded 50 friends in your book, you will not be able to communicate with any new friends.  If you try to meet a new friend, the screen at left will appear.  You will have to remove old friends to make room for the new ones.<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/wakare.gif" ALIGN=left><BR>To remove an old friend's entry, go to a friend's gender or friendship level screen.  From there, press the A button and a screen asking if you want to part ways will appear.  Choosing yes will take you to a confirmation screen.  Choosing yes on the confirmation screen will completely remove the record of that friend.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="tamaplus/screens/omiai.gif" ALIGN=left><BR><BR>If your tamagotchi has been at the breeding age for 72 hours without marrying, Mrs. Busybody will arrive to arrange a marriage.  She shows up three times a day, at 10am, 3pm and 7pm.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
