As you walk, look in the upper right corner of the screen to see how many steps you've taken.  Furthermore, as you accumulate steps, you collect points.  While Sakura is staying in a location, you will get 1 point for every 10 steps you take.  While she is in "idou" or "sansaku" (travelling between locations - see details below), points will not be collected.  With the points you've collected you can ride in vehicles or play a mini game.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#9e62af" SIZE=2>*When you've reached 1,000,000 steps, the counter will go back to 0, however your gallery and data will not be erased.</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#F0A600">When Sakura is drinking tea</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC="sakura/sakura2.gif" ALIGN=right>If you talk to Sakura while she is relaxing and drinking tea, the "idou" "sansaku" screen will appear (more details below).

When Sakura reaches her destination, she will let you know with an "arrival sound".  If you talk to Sakura now, she will tell you that she has arrived.  At the destination, she can meet with members of Hanagumi and visit famous landmarks.  When she's finished at a location, she'll have some tea and relax.<BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="sakura/sakura5.gif"></CENTER><BR><BR>
