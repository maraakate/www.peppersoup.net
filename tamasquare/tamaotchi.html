    Note:  I don't actually have this tamagotchi.  (thanks, Sailopfat!)  I've now included information from the official Tamaotchi website, found <A HREF="http://www01.studiokk.co.jp/tamao/">here</A>.<HR><BR>
    <H3>Before you raise Tamaotchi</H3>
    <B>1</B> Take out the plastic tab from the back of the case.  The unit will beep and 3 eggs will appear.<BR>
    <B>2</B> Press the reset button on the back of the case.<BR>
    <B>3</B> Set the time<BR>
    <B>4</B> Choose an egg.<BR>
    <B>5</B> In about 5 minutes, the egg will break open and the first step towards becoming a big star/actress will begin.<BR>
     *until the tamaotchi grows legs, the only functions that will work are the clock set and reset<BR>
   <CENTER><IMG SRC="tamao/eggs.gif"><BR>
   The three eggs that you can choose from each have different values for certain "hidden parameters" [I assume that these "parameters" define the characteristics of the character you raise].  These values are assigned randomly, so it is possible to raise different characters using the exact same methods of care each time you hatch an egg.<BR></CENTER>

    <H3>How to raise Tamaotchi</H3>
    When Tamaotchi beeps and greets you [a message appears on the screen - the one in the instruction booklet in this section says "good morning"] use the A button to select the 'osewa' mark [the little icons along the top and bottom of screen] and use the B button to select it and give Tamaotchi whatever she needs.<BR>
    *To find out what Tamaotchi is saying/wants, use the check meter:<BR>
     [first screen] Age and weight<BR>
     [second screen] Discipline/training [this is a hard word to translate]: when Tamaotchi is being selfish, scolding her will raise her discipline rating.<BR>
     [third screen] Hungry<BR>
     [fourth screen] Health/Happiness: playing the game will raise this one<BR>
     [fifth screen]Training<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Communicating with sound!</B><BR>
    These are the times when you should 'talk' to your Tamaotchi:<BR>
    1. When rehearsal went really well  -->praise (training increases)<BR>
    2. When she gets angry about taking her medicine -->calm her down<BR>
    3. When she disappears from the screen -->call her back<BR>
    4. If she forgets who you are when she wakes up in the morning -->remind her<BR>
     <B>*How to communicate:</B><BR>
       Lightly tap the side of the case while talking to Tamaotchi.  When your voice is 'recieved' by Tamaotchi, a ))) mark will appear on the screen.<BR>
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="tamao/toile.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Toilet</B>Clean up any messes.  If there are more than two on the screen, it will take more than one flush to clean them away.<BR>
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="tamao/kyu.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>"Rest/break"</B><BR>
     When you select this icon, use the A button to choose from "Meal", "Snack" and "Letter".   When Tamaotchi is hungry, select meal, when you need to increase her happiness select snack and if she's being selfish, select letter.<BR>
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="tamao/goki.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>"Gokigen UP game"</B><BR>
     Use A button to stop the A slot, B button to stop the B slot, C button to stop the C slot.  You need 3 of a kind to win (or lose) - the number of Happiness hearts that will be filled depends on which pictures you match.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>"Rehearsal"</B><BR>
    When you select this icon, you can choose from "Ad-lib", "Dance" or "Acting".  Using the A and B button, indicate which actions for each of the 3 types of performances you'd like Tamaotchi to rehearse [see table below].  If she does them all correctly, tap the case and praise her.  If she does them incorrectly, press the A button to try again.<BR>
    <TABLE BORDER=1>
       <TR>
         <TD>A button</TD>
         <TD>B button</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
         <TD>Acting 'senile' [that's a very literal translation]</TD>
         <TD>Acting [erm, dunno how to translate this, but assume it's the opposite of 'senile']</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
         <TD>Dancing left</TD>
         <TD>Dancing right</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
         <TD>Acting sad</TD>
         <TD>Acting happy</TD>
       </TR>
    </TABLE>
    You must perform 3 'sets' of rehearsals.  IF she gets 2 of the 3 sets correct, her training level will go up one.<BR>
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="tamao/shitsu.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>"Discipline"</B><BR>
    When Tamaotchi is being selfish, select this icon to discipline her.<BR>
    *These are the times when Tamaotchi is being selfish:<BR>
     1. Her hunger, happiness and training meters are full, but she still calls.<BR>
     2. Her hunger meter is empty, but she won't eat.<BR>
     3. Her happiness meter is empty, but she won't play the game.<BR>
     4. Her training meter is empty, but she won't rehearse.<BR>
    In the case of situation #1, simply discipline her.  For situations #2-4, you can give her a 'fan letter' [see the bit on "rest/break"] to 'cure' her selfishness.<BR>
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="tamao/kusu.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>"Medicine" </B><BR>
    When the little skull appears on the screen, Tamaotchi is sick.  Use this icon to give her medicine to make her better.  When she drinks it, her happiness meter will go down one.  Tap the case and talk to her to calm her down after she takes the medicine.<BR>
    <BR>
     <IMG SRC="tamao/den.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>"Lights"</B><BR>
    When Tamaotchi goes to sleep, be sure to turn the lights off for her.<BR><BR>
    <B>"Penalty Sign"</B><BR>
    Tamaotchi will always greet you with the message "good morning" [I'm assuming that this is in the morning when you either turn the lights on or she turns the lights on].  But if you don't acknowledge her greeting [or something to that effect - sorry, I'll translate this bit better later], she'll forget about you and will greet you with a different message.  When this happens, press the A button, and tap the case to get her to remember you.<BR>
    <BR>
    <H3>Stage time!</H3>
    Once a day for 30 minutes, Tamaotchi will rehearse on stage with a spotlight.  When she will start her stage rehearsal depends on which character you have.  During Stage time, the only icon you will be able to use is the check meter.<BR>
