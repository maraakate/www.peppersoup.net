<CENTER><H3>Let's Play!</H3>

<IMG SRC="slump/fortune.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>

Pressing the A or B button will show you the various results.<BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="slump/compatban.gif"><BR></CENTER>
You can check your compatibility with that person you like!  (Doesn't matter if they are the same or different gender as you)<BR>

<B>5.</B>  When the Touch Screen appears, have the other person touch Gacchan's antennae (for at least 2 seconds).<BR><BR>

Now, I wonder who will come out of the egg capsule?  The character that emerges will depend on your compatibility percentage.  Occasionally, events like Gacchan eating the capsule, or strange characters appearing can happen too.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="slump/compatibility.gif"><BR></CENTER>
<BR>

<B>2.</B>  To keep the character, select the upper option.  If you don't want to keep it, select the bottom option.  (A to toggle, B to enter).
**You can only keep one character at a time.  If you choose to record a new character, the previous recorded one will be erased. <IMG SRC="slump/record.gif" ALIGN="right"><BR>
<B>3.</B>  If you see your recorded character on the main screen, everything is ok.
**If you press the C button you can change from Gacchan or your compatibility character on the main screen.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="slump/datacheck.gif"></CENTER><BR>
