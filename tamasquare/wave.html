    <H3>What is Wave UFO?</H3>
     Alerting you to incoming cellular phone or PHS messages, capturing radio/electronic waves and transforming, playing with the slot or janken (rock scissors paper) game... Wave UFO is a new portable tool - a toy in which a helpful denpa (electronic/radio wave) alien lives!  Give it energy, replace its polluted air, and care for it lovingly.

       There are 26 different types of aliens.  They lead a very systematic lifestyle and so are only active from  9:00 am to 1:00 am. Outside of that time period, it is impossible to communicate with them.<BR>

       It seems that game points can have a bad influence on transformations.  Also, if the denpa alien recieves waves while playing the slots game, it will suspend the game and transform.

      <UL><IMG SRC="wave/janken.gif" ALIGN="right">
        <LI>After pressing the B button, press the A button and a countdown will start.  When the exclamation mark (!) appears on the screen, press A (rock), B (scissors) or C (paper).  If the player (that would be you) wins, the denpa alien becomes happy.    *Pressing the D button will return you to the main screen</LI>

       The denpa alien's motto is 'Fair Play'.  If you put out your rock/scissors/paper selection too late (after the denpa alien has already put his out), the "AGAIN" alert will appear and the current game will be invalidated.  Also, if you quit while in the middle of the game, you will be penalized.
      <HR>
      <H3>Caring for your denpa alien</H3>
      <UL>
        <LI>Pressing the C button will bring up the 'care' screens like the ones pictured below.  Use the A button to choose which type of care you want to give and then use the B button to select it.  Use the D button to cancel.  However, if it is a type of care that the denpa alien doesn't like, it won't have any effect.</LI>

         <LI>When your denpa alien is low on health or wants to play, it will show the !! mark and beep.  The attention call will sound for 30 seconds.  To stop it, press any of the buttons.</LI><CENTER><IMG SRC="wave/call.gif"></CENTER>

        If you answer to your alien's call within 5 minutes, it is possible to earn double the usual effects that playing the games or giving care would normally give.

      <H3>When your alien goes into suspended animation...</H3>
      <UL><IMG SRC="wave/life.gif" ALIGN="right">
        <LI>When your denpa alien's health gets to 0, it will be placed in a suspended animation device and you will not be able to play with it or tend to it (care - the air and stuff like that).  You can try to revive it by giving it electric/radio wave shocks.  If you do revive it, it's health stats will return to their original levels and its age will return to 1 year.</LI>
