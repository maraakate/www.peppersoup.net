      <P>When King Debirutchi the First retired, he turned the throne over to his son, the young King Debirutchi the Second despite, the younger Debirutchi's lack of confidence in being King of Devil World.<BR>
      Even though he has a proper place to live at Debirun Castle, he often spends nights alone in the LightHouse on Gaikotsu Cape, watching the stars. Even though he strong magical powers, he only feels emptiness about his abilities.</P>
      <P>6 days after transforming into DebiruDori; DP is over 8? and the Happy and Hunger meters aren't filled; when he has a naughty episode, don't use Kamidanomi and he will change into King Debirutchi.  This is a slightly difficult one to get.  Do one step wrong and your Debirutchi will simply return to DevilWorld.

      <P>This Debirutchi has a very nice personality, always trying to help people in trouble.  For some reason, it tries to fulfill all the number one achievements of the Angeltchi.  Why in the world is it so attracted to Angeltchi?!<BR>Just the thought of it is enough to make your hair stand on end.</P>
      <P>6 Days after it becomes Devil-Mametchi; Happy meter is full and DP is under 1?; when you shake hands, it will turn into KuriDebirutchi.</P><BR><BR><BR>

      <P>Joker Bruno and 'straight-man' Pinky, the comedy duo from Devil World.<BR>
       Of course, the main attraction of these two is their entertainment talents.  This cute combo has caused a lot of problems in the Angeltchi world by converting many angelgotchi fans into devilgotchi.  This pair's duet song has enchanted even the angeltchi.  Their song "Black Dream Love Boogie Woogie" is #1 on the hit charts.</P>
      <P>If your DevilKotchi has Nakayoshi 4 and DP is over 7?, it may change into Futago-Debiru just before it returns for DevilWorld.
