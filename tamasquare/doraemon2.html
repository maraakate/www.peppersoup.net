4.  Let's play with the Secret Tools!!<BR></FONT></B>
   Doraemon is an excellent Helper Robot, and has many secret tools.  If Doraemon is not being selfish, is not broken down, is not sleeping, is not being called on by friends, is not being frightened by a mouse, you can freely use the tools that you've collected.<BR>
<BR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#8B008B"><B>4th dimension pocket (how to use Secret Tools)</FONT></B><BR></CENTER><BR>
  When you've gotten a secret tool, highlight the pocket market with the A button and select with the B button.  The Secret TOol screen will come up (press the C button to go back to the main character screen).
Then, pick the secret tool you want to use with the A button and Select it with the B button.  Doraemon will get the selected tool from his 4th dimesion pocket for you.<BR>
*You can cycle through the selection of secret tools (there are 10 in all) using the A button.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="images/yaku.jpg" ALIGN="left"><P ALIGN="middle"><B>Konnyaku?</B><BR>
Konnyaku is very common in Japanese cooking.  It is a sort of jelly-ish cake made from a kind of tuber.  The texture is sort of crunchy chewy and the taste is non-existant.  No, really.  It's most commonly used in Japanese style stews. Check out <A HREF="http://www.konnyaku.com/e_data/">this link</A> for more Konnyaku info.<BR><BR>
<B>Bamboo Copter?</B><BR>
I assume the Bamboo Copter is a takeoff on the traditional Japanese toy, the Take (bamboo, pronounced tah-keh) Tombo (dragonfly).  Wanna make your own? Have a look <A HREF="http://www.taketonbo.org/index.html">here</A>.  (much more enjoyable than konnyaku)

<B>Air Pistol</B><BR>
 Doraemon will use this to drive off mice.  He will start with this item in his posession, but it will not show up in his 4th dimension pouch with the other items.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=#FF0000">*</FONT>There are some secret tools that have 2 different effects.  Try them all many times to see which ones.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=#FF0000">*</FONT>Items that you can't use even when you select them are items that will be used automatically...<BR>
<FONT COLOR=#FF0000">*</FONT>When you want to end the effect of a secret tool, use the same secret tool that you used.<BR><BR><BR>
