[There's some kind of heavy Japanese pop culture reference here that I'm completely unfamiliar with.  Sendatchi is a nod to another Japanese entertainer, Senda Mitsuo who has apparently coined a catch phrase of sorts, "naha naha" and as such, all Sendatchi ever says is "naha naha!  Senda! wonderful!"]<BR>
Sendatchi is quite a difficult character to get.  So, if you do get Sendatchi and get to show it to Senda Mitsuo, he'll probably be very happy and give you a present.  But, it's pretty embarassing to use the care methods required to get Sendatchi.
