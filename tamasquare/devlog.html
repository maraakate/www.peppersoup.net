<H3>An update! February 29, 2004</H3>Spurred on by the excitement and anticipation of new tamagotchi's, I went and had a look at my modest v-pet collection - not just for nostalgic reasons, but also to check that all the batteries were taken out (batteries left in can corrode and ruin your v-pets!).  I gave Crowley 2 another go and his screws started to just barely move.  With firm, but gentle pressure and slooooooow turns of the screwdriver, I managed to get him opened up.  Yippee!<BR>
So, not all soft screw stories end in tragedy. :)
<P></P>
<HR>These logs are, unfortunately, long dead - Real Life seems to get in the way of my tamagotchi-ing far too much these days :(   For now, I'm leaving these pages up for the tiny bit of info in them... and for the dire warning about soft screws - Crowley 2 succumbed to the same problem as Crowley 1 *sob* and until I can somehow get those screws out, he's resting in the comfort of his packaging... <HR>
<H3>February 27, 2000</H3>Well, so much for trying to stay on top of this log...
;)<BR>Crowley is, happily, functional - he's had none of the problems that poor
old Crowley1 experienced. Right now I'm raising him relatively well, with one
exception - I let his poop pile up until all you can see is 8 dancing piles on
the screen. I think I'll end up getting the very worst adult (have already
gotten oyajidevil). Ah - an interesting note here - I had been wondering about
the growth chart as it appears that you can only get certain "teenage"
characters from certain "baby" characters, but I ended up getting Oyajidevil
from Debirutchi so obviously the arrows on the growth chart aren't entirely
accurate.

<H3>December 14, 1999</H3>
<CENTER><IMG src="units/crowley2.gif"><BR>A New
Beginning!</CENTER><BR><BR>Yes, Crowley has been resurrected in a new body... I
got Crowley2 from the Friends Toystore and started him up as soon as I got him.
He's now turned into a Pukudebirutchi... I kept him well fed and played with,
butlet his DP hover between 65 and 70. I thought I'd get something worse, but
ended up with the best adolescent character...go figure. Maybe I should let his
dp get higher next time. He changed today at age 3 and promptly held out his
little hand in a gesture of friendship. I reciprocated... S'good to have him
back :) Friends still has a few devilgotchi in stock so go now if you want one!
<P></P>
<H3>November 15, 1999</H3>The End<BR>Well, after my last log entry here, I gave
Crowley some time off. Eventually I got brave enough to put his batteries back
in and he ran fine for a few days and then I found him with his screen stuck
halfway between the default screen and the clock screen. None of his buttons
worked. I reset him and his beeping was really weak and his animation was slow,
but all his pixels showed up nice and dark and for a few fleeting minutes he
danced happily on his screen as my favourite little Debirutchi and then he
froze. He didn't fade out or anything, just stopped moving. Pressing the buttons
did nothing. I decided that it was time to put him out of his misery so I
removed his batteries for good. Sniff...Goodbye Crowley...I'll miss
you...<BR>I'm currently trying to get a new Devilgotchi - as I've noted many
times before, the Devilgotchi is my favourite. If I get really desperate, I may
put out a plea for someone to trade me a Devilgotchi for my spare Morino and a
gen2 US tam. But we'll see...
<P></P>
<H3>October 7, 1999</H3>Once again, poor old Crowley is struck down by
tragedy... He had only been running for a day or so and was a Deviltchi, but
when I checked on him, the screen was blank. Eek! I could get the meter screens
and the clock screen, but nothing was showing up on the default screen. I took
his batteries out and haven't touched him since. I'm giving him a little rest...
Keep your fingers crossed for him - hopefully when I put his batts in again, all
will be well.
<P></P>
<H3>September 21, 1999</H3>Ok, I know in my I've got
Crowley listed as running, but...well, I lied. I was too lazy to update the
table so I left it as is. I had given him a batt transplant, but even those
batteries weren't juiced up enough to keep him going...he faded out a few days
after my last entry. Hopefully I'll have fresh batteries for him sometime this
week.
<P></P>

<H3>August 25</H3>Now, where was I... ah yes. Well, my hopes of getting a secret
character from Kabodebi-chi were dashed when his batteries abruptly died on me.
I was worried that it might be a malfunction due to his recent operation, but a
quick batt-transplant brought him back to life. He's only been up and running
for a few days, but I had to restart him this morning when the tape holding him
together got too loose and his batts weren't making their connections. But that
was quickly remedied with the most useful of all inventions, duct tape. Above is
a picture of post-op Crowley (pre-duct tape), as promised.
<P></P>
<H3>July 1, 1999</H3>Hooray! I got the Kabodebi-chi! :) It took Crowley forever
to change too...didn't do it until he was 8. I've been keeping the sound off
most of the time, so I only got to catch one event so far...and I didn't even
see it. But around 3:00pm I heard what sounded like the surfing music (this was
while Crowley was an Oyaji Devil). Pooh...I woulda liked to have seen that. Oh,
for those of you wondering about the name 'Kabodebi-chi'... Kabo is from Kabocha
(pumpkin) and Debi is of course from Debiru (devil). I'm hoping to (at some
point) translate the descriptions of each character from the Bandai Japan
website and put them up somewhere around her. Someday... ;) Keep your fingers
crossed for Crowley to turn into the secret character!
<P></P>
<H3>June 22, 1999</H3>Woohoo! Today Crowley finally changed into his 'teenage'
form and (hooray) this time I got Oyaji Devil! It's funny because I also have
Oyaji-tenshi on my Japanese version angelgotchi right now... Anyway, I got Oyaji
Devil by letting the DP stay around 75. I didn't let his hearts get empty at any
point, but I always waited until his nakayoshi (friendliness/happiness) stars
went down two before playing the game with him (getting all four stars in his
mouth in one game fills two Nakayoshi stars). From this point on I'm going to
take relatively good care of him in hopes of getting the Kabodebi-chi (pumpkin
devil).
<P></P>
<H3>June 14, 1999</H3>Eeep...well, I was trying to get a mid or lower range
character, but I guess I overdid it...Crowley died today. When I looked down at
him he was glaring at me and when I pressed the button he went "POOF" and turned
into an irate bat with the words "BAD END" next to it. Heehee! No worries,
though...I'm restarting him right now... And the Crowley's new incarnation
is...Debirutchi! Hooray!<BR>
<H3>June 13, 1999</H3>Finally! Crowley is back in action! As I wrote in the Tam Diary, I had some
serious trouble getting Crowley opened up to change his batteries. I initially
tried a #0 crosspoint screwdriver which has worked well on all my keychain vp's
to date...Japanese tams, U.S. tams, gigapets, everything. For some reason,
Crowley just wouldn't open up and I ended up accidentally stripping the
screw-head a bit... I had some trouble with Fern, my morino as well, but by that
time I was too paranoid to really try, for fear of wrecking her screws like I
did with Crowley, so I didn't really try. When I took to two of them to a
jewellery/watch repair shop today, I was told that Crowley's screws are actually
smaller than Fern's. The guy there told me to try a different watch repair shop
in the same mall so off I went and the guy there ended up wrecking the screws
even more, leaving me in a bit of a quandary... When I got home, I decided that
it was worth wrecking Crowley's outer case to get him working again and so I
half cut/half pried about a centimeter off the back cover. This left me just
enough room to replace the batteries. I've had to tape the new batteries in
there, so poor Crowley doesn't look quite as good as he did before his surgery,
but he's working and that's what really counts.<BR>This time around Crowley
emerged as a Zukidebitchi. So far I haven't seen any events, but I've only had
him running for a few hours now. I'm going to try for one of the mid-range
characters, so I won't always discipline him or shake his hand when he's trying
to be friendly (s'mean, I know... ;). Check back for more updates...I'm hoping
to update these logs quite frequently this time around.
<P></P>
<H3>May 11, 1999</H3>Ok, maybe this doesn't really count as an update, but I
just thought I'd mention that I do have the batteries for Crowley, I just need
to find a small enough screwdriver to open him up...this could take some time...

<P></P>
<H3>May 2, 1999</H3>Eep! Didn't realize it had been this long. Well, bad news
folks... A couple days after I wrote that last (and first) log entry, Crowley's
batteries died. I had suspected that they wouldn't last long because Crowley's
beep is so loud. I promise to get more batteries and fire him up again as soon
as possible so I can get these logs underway.
<P></P>
<H3>December 10, 1998</H3>Ok, this morning at 9 I restarted Crowley. He appeared
as a Zukidebitchi. I was kind of hoping for a Debirutchi because that has become
my favourite character, but I didn't feel like resetting him again. This is
about the 5th time I've restarted him in the past week or so...I've been rather
busy and I keep forgetting about him so in his past 5 incarnations or so, he
hasn't made it past the age of 1. Eeep. This time I'm trying to go for one of
the worst characters so I'm not playing games with him or shaking his hand and
I'm only disciplining him when he gets too difficult to handle (usually when his
DP hits about 75). So really, all he gets from me is pie and chocolate. I've
noticed that it takes 2 chocolates to fill one happy star...I didn't think it
was like that before but I'll keep a closer eye on it and if this really is the
case then I'll post the changes in my Devilgotchi instruction page. So far
things have been pretty uneventful, as usual. Like the morino, the devilgotchi
doesn't go through an initial needy phase. He seems to empty one happy star and
one hungry circle about once every hour or so. Stay tuned for more details...
