<B>Translation/Cultural notes regarding this map:</B><BR>
The map had two terms that I had difficulty translating and I had to do a bit of research on the internet to learn more about them.  Unfortunately, the only sites I could find with details about them were in Japanese, so please take the information below with a grain of salt - the terminology regarding these words was relatively complex and my Japanese isn't great to begin with.<BR>
Edo is the former name of Tokyo.  For more information about the Edo era, look <A HREF="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2128.html">here</A>.<BR>
<B>"Goshikifudou"</B><BR>
This term can be broken down as follows:<BR>
goshiki = "five colours"<BR>
fudou = "immovable"<BR>
The Goshikifudou are five 'monuments' (using the term loosely here) that were set up around Edo to protect the city.  The five colours, blue, white, red, black and yellow, protect the East, West, South, North, and center, respectively.  The five colours are symbolic of the Buddhist deity, Fudou Myo-o.  From <A HREF="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~QM9T-KNDU/buddhism.htm">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~QM9T-KNDU/buddhism.htm</A>:<BR>
"Fudo {foo-doh} Myo-o, or Acalanatha in Skt. Means the Immovable. The God of Fire, or Acala-vidyaraja. He usually holds a sword in his right hand and a rope in his left. He is standing up threateningly in order to destroy the devils who oppose the practice of Buddhist virtue, with his bare teeth and glaring down furiously. The background of flames is for the purification of the mind; the sword is to fight against the devil. The rope in his left hand is to bind the devils. The statue of Fudo Myo-o occupies the central position of the Five Myo-o and is surrounded by his four attendants. In Kamakura, Joju-in and Myo-o-in are consecrated to it."<BR>
To see photos of the Goshikifudou, look <A HREF="http://www3.justnet.ne.jp/~tamio-enomoto/index5/5fudo.html">here</A>, the source of the information cited above.  The site is in Japanese, but each thumbnail has its name written in its corresponding colour next to it (the yellow is labeled with yellow text).<BR>
<B>"Rokujizou"</B><BR>
Again, from <A HREF="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~QM9T-KNDU/buddhism.htm">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~QM9T-KNDU/buddhism.htm</A>:<BR>
"In Japan, Jizo Bosatsu is popularly believed to be the guardian deity of children including aborted fetus and is ubiquitous roadside icons, which are often clothed in red bib."<BR>
Approximately 300 years ago, these Jizou statues were built on the major highways of Edo to protect travellers.  For pictures of five of these statues, look <A HREF="http://members.tripod.co.jp/Don_Quijote/domestic2/6jizo.html">here</A>.  This site is also in Japanese.  The locations of the Jizou statues shown are, from top to bottom, Shinagawa Temple, Touzen Temple, Taisou Temple, Shinshou Temple, and Reigen Temple.<BR>
<B>Rengatei</B><BR>
Rengatei is an actual restaurant in Ginza.  For some interesting info about it, click <A HREF="http://www.inter-g7.or.jp/g7/wabisabi/rengatei/home-e.html">here</A>.<BR><BR>
