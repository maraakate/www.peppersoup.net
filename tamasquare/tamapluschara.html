**Kinkomochi is a type of Japanese dessert - mochi (pounded rice cake) rolled in soybean powder.  You can see a picture <A HREF="http://www.suisan.n-nourin.jp/oh/recipe/handmade/kinakomoti.htm">here</A>  The reference to his jealousy is part of a play on words - "yakimochi" is roasted rice cake, but can also mean 'jealous person' or personality.  Mochi, when roasted, also has a tendency to puff up, hence the inflated head.</TD></TR>
