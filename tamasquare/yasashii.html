*Story*
One day, after drinking sake that he recieved from Oyajitchi, the Tamagotchi Planet started singing in a loud voice. "We can't have this" said the Tamagotchi and the fled from Tamagotchi Planet.  However, because of a breakdown in their UFO, they crashed on the Earth.  There, in the river where they fell, is where Professor Hakase Banzo found them.  Together with his assistant, Mikachu, they wondered if there was some way for the Tamagotchi to live happily on Earth. "That's it!  We'll build homes for the Tamagotchi!"
So, when the houses for the Tamagotchi had been built, the Tamagotchi went to live with people all over the world and were loved and lived in happiness.
Hakase's devotion to Tamagotchi lead him to build this Tamagotchi House, "Yasashii Tamagotchi" which is easier to raise.
Please give it lots of love and care.<BR>
<P>Explanation of the unit</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="yasa/volume.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Before raising a tamagotchi</P>
To begin raising a tama, you must first reset the unit and set the clock<BR><IMG SRC="yasa/egg.gif" ALIGN=center>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><UL>
<LI>If you don't set the clock, the tamagotchi won't be born</LI><BR>
<LI>Until the tamagotchi is born, you cannot use any functions except clock and reset.<BR></FONT></LI></UL>
With this tamagotchi, you can now tell what your tamagotchi is feeling by the buttons that light up.<BR>
Try pressing the lit Feeding Button.  See!  Food has been dispensed.<BR>
You can tell what care needs to be given without looking at the check meter!<BR>
