  <P>We are Moru and Rora, sisters of the Eriasu family.  Mothra comes from an island far, far in the south called "Infant Island".  A newly hatched Baby Mothra is a tiny, weak baby.  Therefore you must give it lots of 'justice power' or it won't be able to turn into a Mothra.<BR>
     Mothra is a strong and beautiful Goddess; a protector of life.  But sometimes, she can take the wrong path which could make her turn into something bad.  At these times, you must discipline her.<BR>
     If Mothra gets sick, you must let her listen to us sing.<BR>
     For the sake of the Earth's future use love and justice to raise Mothra to be a magnificent adult.</P>
  <BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/check.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>The Check Meter</B><BR>
  The first screen of the check meter shows your Mothra's age and weight in tons.<BR>
  The second screen shows how hungry Mothra is.  Feeding her leaves will fill hearts.<BR>
  The third screen shows how happy she is. Playing (and winning) the Gokigen Up game or feeding her cake will fill hearts.<BR>
  The fourth and last screen show's Mothra's 'justice' level.  This will go up as you discipline her.<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/feed.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Feeding</B><BR>
  The top option is meal and the bottom option is snack<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/game.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Gokigen Up Game</B><BR>
  Use the A button to move the arrow over the holes along the bottom of the screen.  When you think you've got it pointed to the one that Mothra is hiding in, press B to select and reveal her.  You get 5 tries to find her each time you play.  If you find her all five times in one game, you get two points (2 happy hearts filled).  If you find her 3 or 4 times, you get 1 point (1 happy heart filled).<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/toilet.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Toilet</B><BR>
  When Mothra leaves you a little pile on the screen, use this icon (A to choose, B to select) to clean it up.  IF you don't clean it up and let it accumulate on screen, Mothra will get sick<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/shitsuke.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Discipline</B><BR>
  If you find Mothra trying to tear down a tower, use this icon to stop her and to discipline her.<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/sing.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Medicine</B><BR>
  If Mothra gets sick, use this icon to get Moru and Rora to sing to her to make her better.<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/light.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Lights</B><BR>
  Use this icon to turn the lights off when Mothra goes to sleep<BR><BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/call.gif" ALIGN="left"><B>Call Icon</B><BR>
  When Mothra is calling you, this icon will light up.  Use the check meter to find out what she needs.<BR><BR>
  *Depending on how you care for her, your mothratchi may transform into characters other than Mothra [see growth chart at bottom of page]<BR><BR>
  <H3>When to discipline Mothra</H3>
  If you find Mothra trying to tear down a tower or if she calls you needlessly, you should discipline her.  This will raise her "justice meter" level.
  <H3>If Mothra turns into a cocoon</H3>
  To change from a larval form to an adult form, your mothratchi must first turn into a cocoon [note that you have to get a specific 'grub' character to have a chance of getting an adult].  The cocoon stage lasts for about an hour during which time you will not be able to feed or play with her.
  <H3>When your Mothratchi passes away</H3>
  When your mothratchi character dies, you will see it's grave on your screen.  From here you can press the C button to see its final age.<BR>
  To restart your mothratchi, press the A and C buttons simultaneously and a new Mothra egg will appear.</P>

  Mothra Growth Chart<BR>
  <IMG SRC="mothraC/mothrachart.gif"><BR>
  <FONT SIZE=2>*The instruction booklet says "Moru and Rora" but the chart from <A HREF="http://tamagotch.channel.or.jp/">the official tam website</A> says "Moru and Mora"</FONT></P>
<HR>From the official Mothra Tamagotchi site at the Bandai Japan Tamagotchi site:<BR>
 If your mothra dies from old age, it will lay an egg before it dies, if it dies from illness, it will not lay an egg.  To hatch a super secret character from this egg, care for it extremely well.<BR>
[I don't know if this means that there is actually another secret character not shown on the growth chart, or if they are referring to the ones already shown.]<HR>
